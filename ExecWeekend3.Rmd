## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}

getwd()

IncomeData <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/13202/Desktop/Harrisburg 4th Sem/Research Methodology/Data/income.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

#Run Descriptive Stats on the data

View(IncomeData)

summary(IncomeData)

str(IncomeData)

#Create a Frequency Table

table(IncomeData$Industry)

#Scatterplots

attach(mtcars)
plot(IncomeData$Industry, IncomeData$F_weekly, main="Scatterplot Example", 
   xlab="Industry", ylab="Female Weekly", pch=19)

```
